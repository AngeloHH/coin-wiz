# Step 1: Basic C++ Concepts
## Objective
- **Understand basic syntax, data types, and I/O operations in C++.**

## Exercises
- **Hello, World!:** Write a simple program to print text.
- **Variables and Data Types:** Write a program to declare and initialize different types of variables (int, float, char, etc.).
- **Basic I/O:** Write a program that asks for the mount that you want to remove from the cashier register.

### Exercise 1: Hello, World!
In this exercise, we will learn how to write a simple C++ program that prints a message to the screen. This is often called a "Hello, World!" program, but we'll customize it with our own message.

#### Code Explanation
Here's the code we'll be working with:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Welcome to Coin Wiz your cashier register favorite!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

#### Line-by-Line Breakdown

#### 1. Include Directive:
```c++
#include <iostream>
```
- This line tells the compiler to include the standard input-output stream library.
- The `<iostream>` library allows us to use `std::cout` and `std::cin` for outputting and inputting data.

#### 2. Namespace Declaration:
```c++
using namespace std;
```
- This line tells the compiler that we are using the standard namespace.
- The `std` namespace contains all the standard C++ library functions and objects like `cout` and `cin`.
- By using `using namespace std;`, we can write `cout` instead of `std::cout`, which makes our code shorter and easier to read.

#### 3. Main Function:
```c++
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
- This is the **main** function where the execution of the program begins.
- Every C++ program must have a `main` function.
- The `int` before `main` indicates that the function returns an integer value.
- The `return` statement ends the `main` function and returns a value to the operating system.
- Returning <u>`0`</u> typically indicates that the program ended successfully.

### Exercise 2: Variables and Data Types
In this exercise, we are expanding on the basic "Hello, World!" program by introducing variables and data types. This will help us understand how to store and manipulate data in a C++ program.

#### Code Explanation
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string proyectName = "Coin Wiz";
    float money = 16;
    char prefix = '$';
    
    cout << "Welcome to " << proyectName <<" your cashier register favorite!\n";
    cout << "Currently the cash register has " << prefix << money << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### New Additions and Changes

#### Variable Declarations:
```c++
string proyectName = "Coin Wiz";
float money = 16;
char prefix = '$';
```
- The data type `string` is used to store sequences of characters, essentially words or sentences, in this case is `"Coin Wiz"` and `proyectName` is the name of the variable where we will store the information.
- To store floating-point numbers (which are numbers that can have decimal points) we usually use `float`, the variable name is `money` and the value is `16`.
- When you only need to store a single character is better to use the data type `char`. In this case, it stores the character `'$'` on the variable name `prefix`.

#### Using Variables in Output:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float money = 16;
    char prefix = '$';
    
    cout << "Currently the cash register has " << prefix << money << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- The `<<` operator is used to concatenate the string literals with the next variable.
- `endl` is used to insert a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line.

### Exercise 3: Basic I/O

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float money = 16, value;
    char prefix = '$';
    cout << "How much do you want to take out?"; 
    cin >> value;
    money = money - value;
    
    cout << "Currently the cash register has " << prefix << money << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### New Additions and Changes

#### Variable Declaration for User Input:
```c++
float money = 16, value;
```
- We have two float variables now, `money` initialized to 16, this represents the initial amount of money in the cash register and `value` will store the amount of money the user wants to remove.

#### Taking User Input:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float value;
    cout << "How much do you want to take out?";
    cin >> value;
    return 0;
}
```
- This prompt is important for guiding the user to provide the necessary input. `cin` is the standard input stream in C++, the `>>` operator is used to take the input from the user and store it in the `value` variable.

#### Updating the Amount of Money:
```c++
float money = 16, value = 5;
money = money - value; // result: 11
```
- This line subtracts the amount the user wants to take out (value) from the initial amount (money). The result is stored back in the money variable, updating its value.
