# Step 2: Functions and Control Structures
## Objectives
- **Learn how to write functions, use loops, and conditional statements.**

## Exercises
- **Conditional Statements:**
- **Loops:**
- **Basic Functions:**

### Exercise 1:
In this exercise, we will introduce conditional statements to check whether the amount of money the user wants to take out is more than what is available in the cash register. If the requested amount is more than the available amount, we will display an appropriate message.

#### Code Explanation
Here's the updated code with the added conditional statement:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float money = 16, value; char prefix = '$';
    
    cout << "How much do you want to take out? ";
    cin >> value;

    // Conditional statement to check if the requested amount is more than 
    // available.
    if (value > money) {
        cout << "Sorry, you do not have enough money in the register.\n";
    } else {
        money = money - value;
        cout << "Currently the cash register has " << prefix << money << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
